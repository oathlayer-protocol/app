# OathLayer — Submission Guide

**Hackathon:** CONVERGENCE (Chainlink) — Deadline: March 27, 2026

---

## Tracks We're Targeting (4 tracks)

### 1. Risk & Compliance — $16K pool (1st: $10K, 2nd: $6K)

**Why we win this:** OathLayer is literally automated risk monitoring + protocol safeguard triggers. CRE monitors uptime, AI Tribunal predicts risk, `recordBreach()` auto-slashes bonds. This is our strongest track.

**What judges want to see:**
- Monitoring, safeguards, automated controls
- Detect risk, verify system health, trigger predefined responses
- CRE Workflow integrating blockchain + external API/AI

**Our pitch angle:**
> "OathLayer automates SLA compliance for tokenized RWA infrastructure. Chainlink CRE monitors uptime every 15 minutes, a 3-agent AI Tribunal Council deliberates adversarially to prevent false positives, and breached providers get bonds slashed automatically — zero human intervention."

**Key demo moments:**
- Live breach: drop uptime → CRE scan → AI Tribunal votes → bond slashed on-chain
- Show the 3-agent deliberation output (Risk Analyst vs Provider Advocate vs Judge)
- Dashboard updating in real-time with breach events
- Compliance gate: only approved providers can create SLAs

---

### 2. Best Use of World ID with CRE — $5K pool (1st: $3K, 2nd: $1.5K, 3rd: $500)

**Why we win this:** We're doing exactly what the track asks — using CRE to bring World ID to a chain where it's not natively supported. World ID verifies on World Chain, CRE relays to Sepolia.

**What judges want to see:**
- World ID integrated with CRE
- Enable World ID on blockchains where not natively supported
- Proof verification on-chain or off-chain via CRE

**Our pitch angle:**
> "World ID is native to World Chain but SLA enforcement lives on Sepolia. OathLayer uses CRE as a cross-chain identity bridge — providers verify via World ID on World Chain, CRE's EVM Log trigger picks up the `ProviderRegistrationRequested` event, runs a ConfidentialHTTPClient compliance check, and relays the verified identity to Sepolia. This pattern generalizes: CRE as a cross-chain identity relay for any chain."

**Key demo moments:**
- World ID verification flow (IDKit v4 → on-chain proof)
- Show WorldChainRegistry contract on World Chain VNet
- CRE relay: event on World Chain → compliance check → `setComplianceStatus()` on Sepolia
- Arbitrator registration also gated by World ID (two use cases, not just one)
- Dashboard shows provider identity proof (nullifier hash, tx hash)

---

### 3. Build CRE Workflows with Tenderly Virtual TestNets — $5K pool (1st: $5K, 2nd: $2.5K, 3rd: $1.75K)

**Why we win this:** Two VNets with State Sync, both with public explorers, real transaction history, multi-chain CRE workflow tested on Tenderly infrastructure.

**What judges want to see:**
- Tenderly VNet Explorer link with deployed contracts + tx history
- GitHub repo with CRE workflows, contracts, deployment scripts, docs
- Clear CRE workflow execution demo
- Documentation of architecture and integration

**Our pitch angle:**
> "OathLayer runs on two Tenderly Virtual TestNets — Sepolia fork for SLA enforcement and World Chain Sepolia fork for provider identity — both with State Sync enabled for live protocol state. The multi-chain CRE workflow orchestrates cross-chain identity relay, AI-powered risk assessment, and automated bond slashing, all testable with Tenderly's unlimited faucet and debuggable via the public explorer."

**Submission checklist:**
- [ ] Tenderly Explorer links (both VNets)
  - Sepolia VNet: https://dashboard.tenderly.co/robbyn/project/testnet/5c780e4f-4df5-4a50-b221-2342cd4b713e
  - World Chain VNet: https://dashboard.tenderly.co/robbyn/project/testnet/d8f04de9-4cc1-4066-b8d3-31ed51ee1d85
- [ ] Show State Sync is ON (proves live state, not stale fork)
- [ ] Multiple tx types visible: registration, SLA creation, breach, warning, compliance
- [ ] README documents Tenderly usage and VNet architecture

---

### 4. Best CRE Usage in World Mini App — $5K pool (1st: $3K, 2nd: $1.5K, 3rd: $500)

**Why we qualify:** Mini App for provider registration + claims inside World App, CRE handles cross-chain relay + compliance.

**What judges want to see:**
- CRE integrated in Mini App architecture
- Cross-chain or off-chain capability via CRE
- Mini App running in World App webview

**Our pitch angle:**
> "OathLayer's Mini App lets providers register and tenants file claims directly from World App. Registration triggers a CRE workflow: World ID proof verified on World Chain, ConfidentialHTTPClient runs compliance check, and identity is relayed cross-chain to Sepolia — all from a single tap in the Mini App."

**Key demo moments:**
- Show Mini App in World App simulator or on device
- Registration flow: World ID → CRE relay → compliance → approved on Sepolia
- File claim from Mini App → CRE reactive scan triggers

**Note:** The dashboard now handles World ID via IDKit v4 directly, so the Mini App is a secondary interface. Emphasize that the Mini App demonstrates CRE enabling multi-chain functionality from a World Chain-only environment.

## Video Script Outline (3-5 min)

### 0:00-0:30 — Hook + Problem
- "What happens when your cloud provider breaks their SLA? Nothing. You file a ticket, wait weeks, maybe get a credit. OathLayer changes that."

### 0:30-1:00 — Architecture Overview
- Quick diagram: World Chain (identity) → CRE (orchestration + AI) → Sepolia (enforcement)
- "5 Chainlink CRE capabilities in one workflow"

### 1:00-2:30 — Live Breach Demo (THE MONEY SHOT)
- Show healthy dashboard
- Drop uptime via mock API
- Run CRE workflow → 3-agent AI Tribunal deliberates
- Dashboard updates: tribunal verdict badge, breach event, bond slashed
- "No human intervention. Three AI agents deliberated adversarially. Bond slashed automatically."

### 2:30-3:30 — Provider Registration + World ID
- World ID verification via IDKit v4
- Compliance check via ConfidentialHTTPClient
- Cross-chain relay: World Chain → Sepolia
- "World ID isn't native to Sepolia. CRE bridges that gap."

### 3:30-4:00 — Claims + Arbitration
- File claim → reactive CRE scan (not waiting for cron)
- Arbitration panel — World ID gated safety valve

### 4:00-4:30 — Tenderly Infrastructure
- Show both VNet explorers with real tx history
- State Sync enabled — live protocol state
- "All verifiable on Tenderly's public explorer"

### 4:30-5:00 — Closing
- Recap: 5 CRE capabilities, 3-agent AI Tribunal, cross-chain World ID, dual Tenderly VNets
- "Automated SLA enforcement. No lawyers. No disputes. Code is law."
